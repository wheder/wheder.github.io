First post in a blog created in [https://jekyllrb.com/|Jekyll] and [https://pages.github.com/|Github pages]. Finally!

I wanted to create a simple blog and not maintain some Wordpress or any other site, the hosting, patching, ...
I also do not want to be locked in some free/paid blog service, in case anything goes wrong..
So, a static pages with git backend seemed quite reasonable. If anything goes wrong with the service, I can easily migrate to ANY webserver, which will just serve my static web/blog. 

Jekyll is a static web generator, written in [https://www.ruby-lang.org/|ruby]. It works, but having no extensive knowledge of ruby, only basic from using [https://capistranorb.com/|Capistrano], it can get stressful.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown|Markdown] is okay, but all the other stuff?

Fortunately, I have collected a few links which helped me build some basic skeleton:
* https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/10-deployment/ - some intro how to propagate the page to Github pages
* https://github.com/envygeeks/jekyll-docker/blob/master/README.md - ease of use, not getting into the details of ruby, Jekyll and stuff, just run it!
* https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/blob/master/_config.yml - some example `_config.yml`, as the turotial does not provide any decent
* https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code - the name says it all
* https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll - how to create Github pages - a few links inside
* https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll - github pages intro
* https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/ - Jekyll intro into index page and styles etc.
* https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/ - extensive configuration documentation for Jekyll
* https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/ - all the variables in the settings
* https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/ - Jekyll layouts intro
* https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/ - how will the directories be organized and how to name things
* https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/ - how regular pages work
* https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/ - probably useless, it requires HTML and not Markdown
* https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/ - including common parts into pages

In the basic first setup, it works somehow acceptable. The file and its URL is quite correct, in the format /_year_/_month_/_day_/*name-of-the-post.html* 

The only thing I am missing is generating full page trees for posts. It does not generate /_year_/_month_/_day_/*index.html* for all the blogposts in one day, neither a list of all posts in a month /_year_/_month_/*index.html* ... this will be my next task to somehow figure out.

In conclusion I am satisfied with this solution, but not overjoyed. Still a win in my book.
