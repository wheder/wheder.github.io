<p>First post in a blog created in <a href="Jekyll">https://jekyllrb.com/</a> and <a href="Github pages">https://pages.github.com/</a>. Finally!</p>

<p>I wanted to create a simple blog and not maintain some Wordpress or any other site, the hosting, patching, …
I also do not want to be locked in some free/paid blog service, in case anything goes wrong..
So, a static pages with git backend seemed quite reasonable. If anything goes wrong with the service, I can easily migrate to ANY webserver, which will just serve my static web/blog.</p>

<p>Jekyll is a static web generator, written in <a href="ruby">https://www.ruby-lang.org/</a>. It works, but having no extensive knowledge of ruby, only basic from using <a href="Capistrano">https://capistranorb.com/</a>, it can get stressful.</p>

<p><a href="Markdown">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown</a> is okay, but all the other stuff?</p>

<p>Fortunately, I have collected a few links which helped me build some basic skeleton:</p>
<ul>
  <li>[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/10-deployment/] - some intro how to propagate the page to Github pages</li>
  <li>[https://github.com/envygeeks/jekyll-docker/blob/master/README.md] - ease of use, not getting into the details of ruby, Jekyll and stuff, just run it!</li>
  <li>[https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/blob/master/_config.yml] - some example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>, as the turotial does not provide any decent</li>
  <li>[https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet] - the name says it all</li>
  <li>[https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll] - how to create Github pages - a few links inside</li>
  <li>[https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll] - github pages intro</li>
  <li>[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/] - Jekyll intro into index page and styles etc.</li>
  <li>[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/] - extensive configuration documentation for Jekyll</li>
  <li>[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/] - all the variables in the settings</li>
  <li>[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/] - Jekyll layouts intro</li>
  <li>[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/] - how will the directories be organized and how to name things</li>
  <li>[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/] - how regular pages work</li>
  <li>[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/] - probably useless, it requires HTML and not Markdown</li>
  <li>[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/] - including common parts into pages</li>
</ul>

<p>In the basic first setup, it works somehow acceptable. The file and its URL is quite correct, in the format /<em>year</em>/<em>month</em>/<em>day</em>/<em>name-of-the-post.html</em></p>

<p>The only thing I am missing is generating full page trees for posts. It does not generate /<em>year</em>/<em>month</em>/<em>day</em>/<em>index.html</em> for all the blogposts in one day, neither a list of all posts in a month /<em>year</em>/<em>month</em>/<em>index.html</em> … this will be my next task to somehow figure out.</p>

<p>In conclusion I am satisfied with this solution, but not overjoyed. Still a win in my book.</p>
